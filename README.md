In this project, I developed a chatbot that can handle multiple documents for question-answering using the following technologies:

- **Streamlit**: Provides an interactive web interface for users to ask questions and receive responses.
- **Google Generative AI**: Powers the chatbot’s ability to generate natural, contextually relevant responses.
- **Python-dotenv**: Manages environment variables securely, including API keys.
- **Langchain**: Handles conversation flow, integrates various models, and manages the interaction with large language models.
- **PyPDF2**: Extracts text from PDF documents, enabling the chatbot to process document content.
- **ChromaDB and FAISS-CPU**: These tools enable efficient vector search and retrieval, allowing the chatbot to search and find relevant document sections quickly.
- **Langchain Google GenAI**: Enhances integration with Google’s generative AI models for robust document querying.

This chatbot is capable of interacting with multiple documents, providing users with precise and insightful answers by retrieving and processing relevant information. The project demonstrates expertise in AI, document processing, and the use of modern machine learning tools for real-world applications.
